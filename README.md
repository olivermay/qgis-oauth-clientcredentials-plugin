# QGIS OAuth2 Client Credentials Plugin

This QGIS plugin allows you to authenticate WFS, WMS, or other HTTP-based services using OAuth2 **Client Credentials Grant** flow.

- Retrieves an access token.
- Refreshes tokens as needed.
- Configures a QGIS Authentication configuration (APIHeader method) with the valid token.
